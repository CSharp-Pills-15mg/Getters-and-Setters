# Getters and Setters

## Pill Category

Language (C#)

## Description

**Do you question the reality?**

Did you ask yourself what is a property in C#? Maybe not. What reason would you have to do that? A property is a property. Just like a field is a field, a method is a method and so on. They are basic elements that we use to create our programs. Right?

**Properties**

But, what if a property is not so basic? What if it is just a syntactic sugar for easier writing two special methods: the getter and the setter for a field?

**Question**

This C# Pill is trying to answer this question:

- Is a property in C# just a syntactic sugar for a collection of two methods or is it more than that?
